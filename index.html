<h1>Isreal's war in Gaza</h1>
<hr>
<p>raeli <b>Prime Minister</b> Benjamin Netanyahu will not accept <i>Hamas'</i> demand for an end to the war in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza, he said Sunday.

    “I work on this around the clock. But to be clear: I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” he said.
    
    <i>Netanyahu</i> said Hamas has demanded an end to the war, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of the hostages.
    
    “If we agree to this, our <i>soldiers</i> fell in vain. If we agree to this, we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” the prime minister said. 
    
    Some context: <b>Netanyahu's</b> comments come amid a report in the Wall Street Journal that the US, <i>Egypt and Qatar</i> want <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=israel&FORM=AWRE">Israel</a> to join a new phase of talks with Hamas that would start with the release of hostages and lead to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from <b>Gaza</b>.
